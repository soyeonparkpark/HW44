Game: 
When you put steak on a frying pan, it is baked. When you pick up the meat with a tong, the meat moves 
along the tongs and when you put it on the frying pan, you get a sizzling sound. And when the color of the steak changes, 
the red mark automatically tells you when the siren sounds are created, so you can eat the right meat.
